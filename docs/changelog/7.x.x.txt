7.3.0
 - NOTICE: The Template Managers group is deprecated.  It has not been removed
   from the system, but you do not have to be in the Template Managers group
   to edit or add Templates.  Those privileges have been transferred to the
   Turn On Admin group.
 - TESTS: The help labels were broken out from the i18n/label.t test into their own
   test.  An environment variable, CODE_COP, is used to enable the long
   i18n/label.t and help/setHelp.t tests.
 - documented the Deactivate Account Template.
 - Added the setNamespace and getNamespace methods to WebGUI::International.
 - Fixed bad caching via codespace in Operation::Help.  The original failed all the time.

   in-memory cache by symbol table lookups into the code itself and saves
   duplicating the i18n entries.

   create problems when handling time zones.
 - Form elements Date, DateTime, and TimeField now return MySQL Date/Time 
   strings when given a MySQL Date/Time string as a default value. This is now
   the recommended method of storing date/time in the database.

   where clause, "join" for making join clauses, and "columns" for adding more
   columns to return.

   Turn On Admin group.
 - TESTS: The help labels were broken out from the i18n/label.t test into their own
   test.  An environment variable, CODE_COP, is used to enable the long
   i18n/label.t and help/setHelp.t tests.
 - documented the Deactivate Account Template.

   in-memory cache by symbol table lookups into the code itself and saves
   duplicating the i18n entries.

   Also added the feature requested in the thread to allow the files to be
   emailed as attachments.

 - fix: RSS From Parent assets should always be hidden from navigation
 - fix: profile field i18ned possibleValues with apostrophes failing
 - Added a new DateTime subclass, WebGUI::DateTime, with convenience methods to

   create problems when handling time zones.
 - Form elements Date, DateTime, and TimeField now return MySQL Date/Time 
   strings when given a MySQL Date/Time string as a default value. This is now
   the recommended method of storing date/time in the database.
 - WebGUI::Search now accepts more rules, "where" for specifying an additional
   where clause, "join" for making join clauses, and "columns" for adding more
   columns to return.

 - WebGUI::AssetLineage::getLineage can now limit the number of records returned
