 - Switched from Apache::Registry/CGI to a pure mod_perl2 interface, which
   increased performance by over 70% to the entire system, and in some cases

   See the help documention for how to use Shortcut overrides and the
   new user preference fields.

6.7.0
 - Added Survey section feature
- Added two new Survey answer types. HTMLArea and textarea.
 - Upgraded the rich editor to 1.45.
 - Rich edit now has three new buttons: paste from word, paste as plain text,
   and fullscreen.
 - Rich editor defaultly does not validate HTML tags and therefore will allow
   the slop that it was stripping out before. While less strict, this is less
   confusing to end users.
 - The Rich Editor no longer second guesses the URL that a user enters.
 - Being in the admins group automatically results in a UI level capable of
   seeing everything.
 - fix [ 1251390 ] Security tab doesn't appear for member of Admins
 - HTTP Proxy URLs can now be up to 2048 characters long.
 - The Edit Branch function now allows you to recursively set meta data.
   (Thanks to Volvo for funding this feature.)
 - Fixed a potential problem where editing a page under rare very rare 
   conditions could destroy the not found page.
 - Added the ability to override the UI Level of any field in the edit form of
   any asset in the WebGUI config file. (Thanks to Volvo for funding this
feature.)
 - Translation providers can now add languageAbbreviation and locale
   properties to their translation in order to activate the translations of
   javascript helper components like the rich editor and the calendar
   date picker.
 - Added the ability to override the UI Level of an entire asset in the config
   file. (Thanks to Volvo for funding this feature.)
 - fix [ 1229042 ] crumbtrail should show full path...

 - fix [ 1229188 ] typo in Help: Collaboration, Post List Template Variables
 - fix [ 1221284 ] Operation\user.pm i18n {internationalize labels}
 - All form field labels have been internationalized.
 - Added hover help. (Special thanks to Colin Kuskie for all his help with
   this.)
 - Removed long since depricated support for the eopro editor.
 - Class icon context menus are now left click enabled rather than right click
   enabled because some users were confused by right clicking on a web page,
   and mac users, having only one mouse button, couldn't do it.
 - Rewrote the asset manager UI to have a little less whiz-bang and a bunch
   more user friendliness due to user feedback.
 - The File and Image assets are now considered utility assets and the default
   way to upload files will be through the File Pile. Anyone wishing to make
   the File and Image assets available as normal assets in the new content
   menu are still able to do so, and existing sites will be left as they are.
 - Added a file cache size limit option to the config file.
 - Added "content type" to Snippets, allowing for CSS, XML, javascript and 
   other file formats to be served directly from a snippet.
 - Enhanced aggregation features of the SyndicatedContent wobject, including
   keyword filtering, content republishing, XSLT stylesheet support and 
   different "display modes".
 - Wrote a whole new caching system for WebGUI that is up to 10 times more
   efficient than the old caching system.
 - fix [ 1216053 ] can't drag to asset manager crumbtrail
 - Updated the calendar picker to version 1.0.
 - Added a mechanism to wobject definitions so that they can dynamically
   generate their getEditForm() method based upon settings in the definition
   if they need no special processing rules. For people familiar with Jakarta
   Struts or Ruby on Rails this will be very familiar. For all other
   developers, just know that it will make writing wobjects that much easier.
   For an example, take a look at the Article wobject's definition() method.
 - Added an optional specification of the asset icon, ui level, and name in the
   definition to have getName(), getUiLevel(), and getIcon() autogenerated for 
   WebGUI::Asset subclasses.
 - fix [ 1239601 ] Thread::getName is not Internationalized (and many other Assets, too)
 - fix [ 1240316 ] Doc erro in Folder template thumbnail => thumbnail.url
 - The Navigation template variable "unfolded_page_loop" was removed a long
   time ago, but the documentation was never updated until now.
 - Created a new pluggable form control backend. See migration.txt for
   details.

   procedure to a fatal error, since this will lead to a false url in the asset
   table. (mkamerbeek/Procolix)

 - Minor performance enhancements to Navigation system.
 - Fixes to online help content. (Colin Kuskie)


6.1.1
 - bugfix [ 991313 ] Manage Translations doesn't work
 - bugfix [ 991677 ] Preload erro my $i earlier declaration
 - bugfix [ 991200 ] scriptUrl option in webgui.conf ignored


6.1.0
 - Changed the output of upgrade.pl for better understanding.
 - Added a --history option to upgrade.pl that displays the upgrade history
   for each site.
 - Fixed a typo in User.pm
 - All plugins are now dynamically loaded. This provides a performance gain of
   over 100% in CGI mode, 10% in mod_perl mode, and less memory usage in
   mod_perl mode.
 - Changed the privileges API significantly. See docs/migration.txt for details.
 - Fixed a bug in articles where articles with no content would fail to
   display their images.
 - bugfix [966466] WebGUI::Session. System crash when user language setting missing.
 - Eliminated the need for Data::Serializer which results in a small amount of
   less memory usage.
 - Rewrote the template API which resulted in a 30% performance increase. See
   docs/migration.txt for details.
 - Added five new caching mechanisms for templates. Each has their own
   benefits and detriments. This allows you to increase scalability and
   performance at a cost of either memory or disk space or both. The gains
   here are primarily enjoyed by large heavy traffic sites that use lots of 
   complex templates.
 - Added convenience methods to Wobject superclass for internationalization,
   wobject ID, and namespace.
 - Added an object-oriented interface to the internationalization system. The
   old procedural interface still works as well.
 - Added on the wire compression to HTTP transport for WSClient wobject.  This
   will have no effect on clients/servers that can't support compression.
 - A small patch from Roy Johnson to deal with different types of WSDLs in the
   WSClient.
 - Adding form param WSClient_skipCache when posting to WSClient wobject
   allows us to ignore even good soap return caches (mostly for testing use)
 - Moved to a compiled internationalization and help system. At a cost of 400 
   kilobytes of RAM, it provides a boost in performance of over 35%. More
   importantly though, it cuts the number of database queries in half on an
   average page, which leads to much greater scalability. See
   docs/migration.txt for API changes.
 - Added the ability to select session v. global caches to WSClient.
 - Rmoved the httpHeader, httpRedirect, and setCookie subs from
   WebGUI::Session and created a new class called WebGUI::HTTP for them. See
   docs/migration.txt for details.
 - The USS automatically adds an RSS feed link tag to the head of any page
   it's on.
 - Added a new API for dynamically adding javascript, css, xml, rss, and meta
   information to the page. See WebGUI::Style for details.
 - Fixed a long standing annoyance that javascripts used by the WebGUI::Form
   would be loaded multiple times if there were multiple fields of the same
   type in the same form.
 - Sped up the page editing page by 50% by rearranging the javascript on the
   page.
 - Added prepared statement handlers to WebGUI::SQL.
 - Added transaction handlers to WebGUI::SQL.
 - Added additional debugging to WebGUI::SQL.
 - Added a better user search mechanism, which works well even with 100,000
   users.
 - Made some minor changes to grouping lookups that resulted in an average of
   18 less database queries per page when in admin mode which results in a 32%
   performance gain while in admin mode.
 - Changed the group and user management interfaces to work and scale better 
   with thousands of users and groups.
 - Changed the config loader to preload the WebGUI config files into memory at
   a cost of ~70k (mem) per site for a 2000% performance gain. It is a huge
   gain, but it was already really fast, so relatively users aren't likely to
   notice the difference. However, this change helps in the overall
   scalability of WebGUI under load.
 - Added the ability to use replicated slave databases to lessen the load on
   the master database. This will have no effect on single database users, but
   can add a tremendous amount of scalability on large WebGUI sites that use
   database replication.
 - Templated the EditableToggle, a, GroupAdd, GroupDelete, H, LoginToggle, r, 
   and AdminToggle macros. Thanks to Colin Kuskie.
