1.3.1
 - Fixed a problem where pages that were cut and pasted could have an ordering problem.
 - Added a missing help icon to the SQL Report (edit).
 - Cleaned up some code in the some of the default widgets.
 - The gateway app (index.pl) can now be located in any directory by modifying two lines of code with any ordinary text editor.
 - Added a link to the help index from every help page.

1.3.0
 - Added a setting to turn off anonymous user registration.
 - Some WebGUI macros are now configurable. For instance you can now format the date macro so that it will display in whatever format you choose.
 - Eliminated some additional compatibility problems for Oracle and Postgres databases.
 - WebGUI has now been verified under IIS as well as Apache.
 - Had to edit the "Last Reply" column of the Message Board widget for database compliance and as a result gave it additional functionality. It now lists the subject, date, and author of the last reply. However, it is slightly slower using this methodology. Unfortunately we can't get around it if we want to be compliant with PostgreSQL.
 - You can now use WebGUI macros in the Site Map widget.
 - You can now choose whether you want the visitor redirected to the home page or to a page not found page if the page they requested does not exist.
 - Updated the help to reflect all changes.
 - Rearranged the "Edit Page" screen to be more intuitive. Also added links to user, group, and style management from that screen.
 - Added distictive privilege messages for vital components and administrative functions. If you try to delete a component that's vital to WebGUI it tells you that you can't do that and why rather than just saying "Permission Denied!". Same goes for users trying to access administrative functions who aren't in the admin group.
 - Updated documentation to reflect a new required Perl module: Tie::CPHash.
 - WebGUI has now been verified under Postgres and Oracle.
 - Fixed a bug where syndicated content would display "$image" instead of the image itself.
 - Moved the runHourly.pl script out into the WebGUI root.
 - Modularized the WebGUI Macro system so that it can be altered and expanded by individual organizations.
 - Fixed a bug where Syndicated Content last fetched date would show in epoch rather than a date/time.

1.2.1
 - Fixed a couple of date related bugs in the message board that were introduced in the last release.
 - Added an update release that fixes a problem with polls for people using WebGUI since the 0.x.x releases.

1.2.0
 - Moved all date functions internal rather than relying upon the database for them.
 - Changed all insert and join syntax to be more database friendly.
 - Updated the "testEnvironment.pl" script to be more crash proof and to check for all types of available database drivers. We believe it's now ready to be deployed as part of the installation process. It will be added to said documentation.
 - Fixed a bug where you were unable to delete an FAQ question.
 - Fixed a bug where setting a poll to be postable by visitors could cause problems with other users voting, including other visitors.
 - Changed a few miscellaneous SQL statements for better compatibility with other databases.
 - Renamed the <b>user</b> table to <b>users</b> because the word "user" is a reserved word in some databases.

 - Fixed a bug where you couldn't delete an FAQ question.
 - Changed the version information in WebGUI to reflect the Perl standards.
 - Changed the pagenation system to be database agnostic by no longer using any sort of <b>limit</b> in the SQL statement. The limit function works differently across many databases and some databases don't even have a limit function.
 - A "purge trash" function was added to the admin menu.
 - If a user makes a submission without a title, the submission is labeled as "Untitled".
 - Added exception handling to SQL Report in case the user gives us an improperly formatted SQL statment.
 - Added error handler warnings to the SQL Report and Search MnoGo systems to notify the sys admins that their users are probably not formatting things correctly.
 - Return the user to the proper page after editing an FAQ question.
