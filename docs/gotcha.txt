This file contains a list of any changes you should be aware of when
upgrading from one version to the next, or even between multiple
versions. Be sure to heed the warnings contained herein as they will
save you many hours of grief.

6.9.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The If macro has been removed because it's far too dangerous and
	error prone. If you use the If macro you may continue to use
	it at your own risk, maintenance, and support cost, but it
	is no longer supported by Plain Black.

 * The session system has been replaced by a new object-oriented one,
	which has caused massive API changes. Please consult
	migration.txt to bring your custom code up to date with the
	new API.


6.8.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Before upgrading you must install the following new Perl modules:
	Data::Structure::Util

 * Fixed a major versioning system bug in this release where when purging 
	the last revision of an asset, if it had children, the children were 
	not purged with it. This may have caused problems in some people's 
	databases if they used any 6.7.x version or 6.8.0. If it has all you 
	need to do to fix it is upgrade to this release and then run 
	sbin/rebuildLineage.pl


6.8.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Before upgrading you must install the following new Perl modules:
	DateTime
	DateTime::Format::Strptime
	DateTime::Cron::Simple
	JSON
	Finance::Quote
	Archive::Zip

   And optionally, these:

	Test::More
        Pod::Coverage

 * If you have previously installed the community contributed version
	of the In/Out Board (IOB) then you will need to completely
	uninstall it before you can proceed with this upgrade.

 * The core API has changed. Check docs/migration.txt for details.

 * WebGUI now requires Apache2 with mod_perl2 so CGI, FastCGI, PerlEx,
	although never officially supported, are no longer possible.
	Making this change gave us more than 70% performance improvement
	and opens up even more possibilities for performance and other
	optimizations.

	You'll need to make the following changes in Apache to upgrade
	to this release:

	Install libapreq2. You can either download and compile this
	from the mod_perl web site, CPAN as Apache2::Request, or by
	getting the version of the WRE 0.6.0 or higher.

	Edit your httpd.conf or httpd.modperl.conf and add the following
	directives to your global server config:

  	LoadModule apreq_module modules/mod_apreq2.so
 	PerlSetVar WebguiRoot /data/WebGUI

	You may also remove this block if you have it:

	<Files ~ "\.(pl)$">
    		SetHandler perl-script
    		PerlHandler ModPerl::Registry::handler
    		PerlOptions +ParseHeaders
	</Files>

	You also no longer need the ExecCGI directive.

	Edit each of your virtual hosts and add the following directives,
	changing them to suit your needs:

	SetHandler perl-script
        PerlInitHandler WebGUI
        PerlSetVar WebguiConfig www.example.com.conf

	If you were using mod rewrite you'll need to adjust your rules
	because they no longer need to remove the gateway (index.pl)
	from the URL.

	If you were using the uploadsAccessHandler.perl you no longer
	need that as it is built in to the WebGUI handler.

	For more information consult the WebGUI Done Right documentation.

 * WebGUI now requires MySQL 5.0 to operate. This is due to the huge
	number of new features afforded us in the MySQL 5.0 database,
	which will increase performance, and add to our functionality
	for the future.

 * WebGUI now requires Perl 5.8 to operate.

 * The Macro API has been changed. If you have any third-party macros
	installed make sure to update them prior to upgrading. See
	docs/migration.txt for details.

 * You may now optionally create sbin/preload.exclude with a carriage
	return seperated list of modules you don't want to be preloaded.
	This file requires each line to contain exactly one full module
	name such as "WebGUI::Asset::Wobject::WSClient" (without the
	quotes) per line. No spaces or additional formatting can be
	present. You may, for example, just copy sbin/preload.exclude.example
	to sbin/preload.exclude and save yourself about 5MB of memory
	because that will eliminate some of the least commonly used
	components. 

	If you mistakenly exclude modules that WebGUI actually needs
	to run, it will load them at run time, and just use more RAM,
	so you don't need to worry about breaking WebGUI. However, this
	doesn't mean you should just exclude everything because doing
	runtime loading will likely use 5-10 times more RAM than just
	preloading them to begin with.


6.7.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * In order to upgrade to 6.7 you must first upgrade to at least 6.6.1.

 * The asset API has changed slightly due to versioning, so if you
	have any custom assets, check out migration.txt to make
	sure they will comply.


 * The templates for Survey assets has changed a little.  After
        upgrading you will notice that your custom view templates
	will not display your questions for editing in Admin mode.
	You will need to put your questions loop inside of a section
	loop.  See the default view template for an example.

 * If you have any SQL reports going against the asset table, note that
	it has been split into two tables "asset" and "assetData" and
	your SQL reports will need to change.

 * The indexed search asset has been disabled until 6.8 where it will
 	be entirely rewritten from the ground up.


6.6.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Please ensure you're running HTML::Template version 2.7, which
        supports javascript escaping and is needed to ensure js
        menus work everywhere. To see what version you're running,
        type:
        perl -MHTML::Template -e 'print $HTML::Template::VERSION."\n"'
        at a command prompt, or alternatively use the
        sbin/testEnvironment.pl script included with WebGUI. If
  	you've had your WebGUI site running on versions prior to 6.4
	then you should delete your lib/HTML folder as it contains
	an outdated version of HTML::Template.


6.6.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * If you created your site using the create.sql script from 6.6.2
        you will need to recreate it from the new create.sql script
        from 6.6.3. The 6.6.2 version has some unrecoverable
        problems in it. If you just upgraded to 6.6.2, you need not
        worry, the upgrade is unaffected by this problem.

 * If you're randomly getting logged out before upgrading to this
        release, clear your browser cache and cookies after upgrading
        to this release and the problem will go away.


6.6.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Perl modules that used to be shipped with WebGUI are now required
	to be installed on your system manually. You can optionally
	just use the WebGUI runtime environment to save yourself
	the hassle of downloading all of them. You can also install
	them using testEnvironment.pl The new modules you'll need 
	to install are:

	Log::Log4perl
	Net::LDAP
	Date::Manip
	DBIx::FullTextSearch
	HTML::Highlight
	HTML::TagFilter
	HTML::Template
	Parse::PlainConfig	
	Tie::IxHash
	Tie::CPHash
	XML::RSSLite
	XML::Simple

 * After upgrading you'll need to create a log.conf file in your etc
	folder for the new logger. For most situations you can just copy 
	log.conf.original to log.conf and you'll be fine. If you want
	to set up custom logging rules, see this web page:
	http://log4perl.sourceforge.net/releases/Log-Log4perl/docs/html/Log/Log4perl/Config.html

* The Payment plugins should provide two new methods: shippingCost and 
	shippingDescription. Plugins that do not have these methods
	will fatal error when checking out.

* The Commerce/ConfirmCheckout template has a lot of new variables to
	use, but also some (existing ones) have been renamed. Please refer
	to the corresponding help file.


6.5.6
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The uploadsAccessHandler.perl script has specific issues with
   various versions of mod_perl and Perl CGI due to the many recent
   changes in mod_perl and Perl CGI. For this reason it may not work
   on your platform. We're working to make a script that will work
   everywhere. Until then, using the latest versions of mod_perl and
   Perl CGI should produce working results.


6.5.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The International Macro must be enabled in all WebGUI configuration
   files for the Help to work correctly.

6.4.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Image Magick is no longer optional.


6.3.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * After upgrading your site you'll have to reset the privileges on
        your uploads folder to make sure that the web server has
        the privileges it needs to write due to a large number of
        changes on the filesystem.

 * In order to upgrade to 6.3.0 or beyond you need to have already
	already upgraded to 6.2.0 or above. The upgrades will fail if
	you try to jump from any 6.1 (or prior) version directly to
	6.3.

 * Your upgrade process will be a little different from here on out.
	Use the following steps to do the upgrade:

	a) Back up everything.

	b) Extract the 6.3 archive over your existing install.

	c) Restart apache (don't shut down as normal, just restart).

	d) Run upgrade.pl in the sbin folder.

	e) Test.

	The reason for this is that WebGUI has an innovative new way
	of releasing sites for public view as soon as they become
	available during the upgrade, even while the other sites are
	still being upgraded. Each site will have a maintenance 
	message displayed until its upgrade is complete.

 * The EmptyTrash scheduler plugin has been removed since there's no
	need for it with the more useful DeleteExpiredTrash module in
	place.

 * This upgrade process will run for a very long time and output a
	lot of debug information which will be useful if something
	goes wrong. You may wish to pipe the debug info to a log
	file like this:
	
	perl upgrade.pl --yourcommandlineoptions > /tmp/upgrade.log

 * If you're using languages other than English, you'll need to get
	new versions of those language files before upgrading. The
	language file format has a new requirement. Also, the
	language files are now all converted to UTF-8.

 * If you were using any non-English language files on your site,
	you may now have to convert your site content to UTF-8
	format. Check with your language file provider for details.

 * If you're upgrading from a release earlier than 5.5.0 then you'll
	need to download and upgrade to 5.5.x before you can upgrade
	to 6.3 or higher.

 * All Site Map wobjects will be migrated to Navigation assets 
	during the upgrade. All the site map templates will
	be lost. If you want them, save them before the upgrade. Also
	check your site after the upgrade for all site maps to make
	sure that they look the way you want them to look.

 * All File Manager wobjects have been migrated to File Folder Layout
	assets. The File Manager templates will be deleted during the
	upgrade, so if you want to keep yours, get them before upgrading.

 * If you have any SQL reports querying internal WebGUI database tables,
	you'll need to update them after the upgrade. Most of WebGUI's 
	database tables will be changed during the upgrade process.

 * If you have any custom page templates, they'll need to be updated
	to work with the new Layout system. The templates have been 
	changed significantly enough that automatic migration of them is
	not possible.

 * You may add optional protection for your uploaded WebGUI files. This
	will check the privileges of the files from the WebGUI database
	before sending them to the browser. To enable this you must use
	these directives:

	PerlSetVar WebguiRoot /data/WebGUI
	PerlRequire /data/WebGUI/sbin/uploadsAccessHandler.perl

	And then add this to each virtual host you wish to protect:

	PerlSetVar WebguiConfig www.example.com.conf
	<Location /uploads>
		PerlAccessHandler WebGUI::UploadsAccessHandler
	</Location>

 * If you have any custom code, please check out docs/migration.txt as
	there have been many changes to the API in this release.

 * There are many new components in this release, and as a result many
	tables. Here is a list of the new tables. Make sure you have no
	plug-ins installed that conflict with this, or tables you've
	created for your own uses: Collaboration, Post, Thread,
	Post_rating, Post_read, Folder, FileAsset, ITransact_recurringStatus,
	ImageAsset, Layout, Shortcut, asset, assetHistory, commerceSettings,
	redirect, shoppingCart, snippet, subscription, subscriptionCode, 
	subscriptionCodeBatch, subscriptionCodeSubscriptions, transaction,
	transactionItem

 * Due to the sweeping changes in this release the migration script may not
	work perfectly on your site. It should get you 90% of the way there,
	but it will be up to you to fix the problems it can't catch. Some of
	the things to look out for are Collaboration System (formerly USS
	and forum) templates. Also look at images and navigations as they've
	been moved from outside the content system, to inside it as assets
	in the new asset tree.

 * If you are using the SMB auth module, please note that it has been removed
	from this release. It has been long deprecated and is no longer an
	official part of WebGUI. It will be made available in the user
	contribs section of plainblack.com for people wishing to continue to
	use/maintain it.


6.2.10
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The recommended default location for the WebGUI log is now
	/var/log/webgui.log instead of /data/webgui.log

 * The default path for WebGUI backups is now /tmp/backups rather than
	/data/backups


6.2.8
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Due to a bug in the theme system, if you created any themes in any
	6.2.x version prior to 6.2.8 they will need to be deleted and
	recreated. Otherwise they will export a corrupt theme file.


6.2.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * If you used 6.1.1 for a while, and feel like there's something
	wrong with your navigation or page tree, then there just
	might be. We corrected a rather large problem in the Page
	system that could have caused page tree corruption. To test
	and fix this problem, get the page tree tools from the user
	contribs area of plainblack.com. Be sure to back up your
	databases before using this tool.


6.2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WebGUI now requires Time::HiRes to operate. Be sure to have it 
	installed prior to upgrading or the the upgrade will fail.

 * Parts of the WebGUI API have changed once again, so be sure that
	any third-party plug-ins you have installed have been updated
	to work with 6.2 before upgrading.

 * A new configuration option has been introduced: 
	exportPath = /path/to/export/dir
	If exportPath is defined in the WebGUI config file, a new 
	"Export" icon will appear in the page toolbar.


6.1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * See docs/migration.txt for changes in plug-in coding.

 * You no longer need Data::Serializer.

 * See docs/migration.txt for changes in the template system.

 * See docs/migration.txt for changes in the Internationalization
	and help systems.

 * If you're using any third-party plug-ins, you'll need to get
	updated versions to work with 6.1.

 * If you're using a language other than English on your current site,
 	you'll need to obtain a language pack from either the user
	contributions or one of the WebGUI Worldwide sites.

 * Each user's language has been reset to the default language for
	the site as specified in the profile settings.

 * We removed a bunch of the cryptic-hack code that was allowing
	backward compatibility all the way back to some 2.x, 3.x, and
	4.x stuff. To be sure that your site will still work, copy
	the gateway script (index.pl) over your old one. Also make
	sure you have extrasPath and extrasURL defined in your config
	file.

 * The ThumbnailLinker macro has been removed. You can now use the
	Thumbnail macro because it is templated.


6.0.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * You need to add all of your site aliases to the sitename variable
        in your WebGUI config file.


6.0.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Apache 2.0 is now the recommended web server for WebGUI. As such
	sbin/preload.perl has been defaulted for use with mod_perl
	2.0. If you are still using Apache 1.3, don't worry, WebGUI
	will still work great for you. You just need to edit
	sbin/preload.perl to match your environment.


6.0.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * As part of the upgrade process our scripts will attempt to
	migrate your styles, page, FAQ, Item, Link List, and
	SQL Report templates. However, the migration scripts are not
	perfect due to the wide-variety of templates out there, so
	you may need to update some portions of your templates
	manually.

 * The Authentication Module API has been completely rewritten.
	Please see docs/migration.txt for details.

 * The Paginator API has been significantly changed.
	Please see docs/migration.txt for details.

 * WebGUI now requires the following Perl modules to be installed:
	Data::Serializer
	SOAP::Lite
	Cache::Cache (no longer optional)

   WARNING: Be sure you install these modules BEFORE you attempt to
	upgrade or the upgrade will fail and you'll have a mess to
	clean up!

 * If you've created any custom Events Calendar templates, they will
	no longer work due to the new template structure for events
	calendars. Your old templates will remain intact, however,
	so that you can migrate them manually to the new template
	variables.

 * The Synopsis macro no longer exists. If you were using it to
	retrieve the current page's synopsis, then please use the
	^Page("synopsis"); macro. If you were using it to build a
	synopsis style navigation please use the new ^Navigation();
	macro.

 * The old navigation system has been entirely replaced. If you've
	built or are using any navigation components that did not
	come with WebGUI then you'll need to remove them and use
	the new configurable navigation system. See migration.txt
	for additional details.

 * The old realtime search subsystem has been replaced with the new
	indexed search wobject. As such, we've removed the ^?; macro.
	If you were using the ^?; macro then you'll need to set up
	a search wobject to replace it.
 
 * Themes that were created with 5.x versions of WebGUI will fail to
	import into WebGUI 6.0. Sometime after the release of 6.0
	(gamma) there will be a theme converter available on
	plainblack.com to convert your old 5.x themes into 6.0
	themes. If you've already imported a 5.x theme you have
	nothing to worry about. All of the theme components will
	automatically be converted to 6.0.

 * If you have any SQL Reports going against any USS, they will need
	to be updated as the USS tables have changed.

 * During the upgrade process you may see some database errors during
	the migration of SQL Reports. Don't be alarmed. Your upgrade
	has not failed. Instead, some of the queries in the SQL Reports
	may have failed and will cause the SQL Report templates to not
	be automatically generated.
