=head1 NAME

Package WebGUI::Asset::Wobject::Survey::SurveyJSON

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Helper class for WebGUI::Asset::Wobject::Survey.  It handles
serializing and deserializing JSON data, and manages the data for
the Survey.  This package is not intended to be used by any other
Asset in WebGUI.

=head2 Address Parameter

Most subroutines in this module accept an $address param. This param is an array ref that 
serves as a multidimensional index into the section/question/answer structure.

In general, the first element of the array is the section index, the second element is 
the question index, and the third element is the answer index. E.g. in its most general
form the array looks like:

 [section index, question index, answer index]

Most subroutines will not expect or require all three elements to be present. Often, the
subroutine will alter its behaviour based on how many elements you provide. Typically,
the subroutine will operate on the most specific element it can based on the amount of
information you provide. For example if you provide two elements, the subroutine will most
likely operate on the question indexed by:

 [section index, question index]

=head2 new ( $session, json )

Object constructor.

=head3 $session

WebGUI::Session object

=head3 $json (optional)

A json-encoded serialized surveyJSON object. Typically this will have just been retrieved from the 
database, have been previously generated from another surveyJSON object using L<freeze>.

See L<freeze> for more information on what the serialized object should look like.

=head2 addType ( questionType, address )

Adds a new multiple-choice question type. If a bundle of the same name already exists, 
the definition for that bundle is updated.

=head3 questionType

The questionType of the multiple-choice question bundle

=head3 address

The address of a question to use as the basis for the new multiple-choice question bundle definition.
After creating the new bundle, the question is updated so that its questionType is set to the name
of the new bundle.

=cut

sub addType { 
    my $self = shift;

    $question->{questionType} = $questionType;
}

=head2 removeType ( address )

Removes a multiple-choice bundle.

=head3 address

The address of the question whose questionType corresponds to a bundle that should be removed. 
After removing the bundle, the question is updated so that its questionType reverts back to
the generic "Multiple Choice" questionType.

=cut

sub removeType {
    my $self = shift;
    my $address = shift;
    my $question = $self->question($address);
    $self->session->db->write("DELETE FROM Survey_questionTypes WHERE questionType = ?",[$question->{questionType}]);

=head2 specialQuestionTypes

Returns the arrayref to the special question types

=cut 

sub specialQuestionTypes {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->{specialQuestionTypes};

=head2 multipleChoiceTypes

Returns the hashref to the multiple choice types

=cut

sub multipleChoiceTypes {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->{multipleChoiceTypes};
}

=head2 freeze

Serialize this Perl object into a JSON string. The serialized object is made up of the survey and sections 
components of this object, as well as the "mold" which is used .

=cut

sub freeze {
    my $self = shift;
    return to_json(
        {   sections => $self->compress(),
            mold    => $self->{_mold},
        }
    );
    
}

=head2 newObject ( $address )

Add a new, empty Section, Question or Answer to the survey data structure.

Updates $address to point at the newly added object. Returns $address.

=head3 $address

See L<"Address Parameter">. New objects are always added (pushed) onto the end of the list of similar objects at the
given address. 

The number of elements in $address determines the behaviour:

=over 4

=item * 0 elements

Add a new section.

=item * 1 element

Add a new question to the indexed section.

=item * 2 elements

Add a new answer to the indexed question inside the indexed section.

=back

=cut

sub newObject {
    my $self    = shift;
    my ($address) = validate_pos(@_, { type => ARRAYREF });

    # Figure out what to do by counting the number of elements in the $address array ref

        push @{ $self->question($address)->{answers} }, $self->newAnswer($address);

        # Update $address with the index of the newly created answer
        $address->[2] = $self->lastAnswerIndex($address);
    }
    # Return the (modified) $address
    return $address;
}

=head2 getDragDropList ( $address )

Get a subset of the entire data structure.  It will be a list of all sections, along with
one question from a section with all its answers.

Returns an array reference.  Each element of the array will have a subset of section information as
a hashref.  This will contain two keys:

    {
        type => 'section',
        text => the section's title
    }, 

The questions for the referenced section will be included, like this:

    {
        type => 'question',
        text => the question's text
    }, 

All answers for the referenced question will also be in the array reference:

    {
        type => 'answer',
        text => the answer's text
    }, 

The sections, question and answer will be in depth-first order:

 section, section, section, question, answer, answer, answer, section, section

=head3 $address

See L<"Address Parameter">. Determines which question from a section will be listed, along with all
its answers.  Should ALWAYS have two elements since we want to address a question.

=cut

sub getDragDropList {
    my $self    = shift;
    my ($address) = validate_pos(@_, { type => ARRAYREF });

    my @data;

                                type => 'answer'
                            }

            }
        }
    }
    return \@data;
}

=head2 getObject ( $address )

Retrieve objects from the sections data structure by address.

=head3 $address

See L<"Address Parameter">. 

The number of elements in $address determines the behaviour:

=over 4

=item * 0 elements

Do Nothing

=item * 1 element

One element is enough to reference a section. Returns that section.

=item * 2 elements

Two elements are enough to reference a question inside a section. Returns that question.

=item * 3 elements

Three elements are enough to reference an answer, inside of a particular question in a section. 
Returns that answer.

=back

=cut

sub getObject {
    my $self    = shift;
    my ($address) = validate_pos(@_, { type => ARRAYREF });

    # Figure out what to do by counting the number of elements in the $address array ref
    my $count = @{$address};

    return if !$count;

    if ( $count == 1 ) {
        return clone $self->sections->[ sIndex($address) ];

            ->[ aIndex($address) ];
    }
}

=head2 getEditVars ( $address )

A dispatcher for getSectionEditVars, getQuestionEditVars and getAnswerEditVars.  Uses $address
to figure out what has been requested, then invokes that method and returns the results
from it.

=head3 $address

See L<"Address Parameter">. The number of elements determines whether edit vars are fetched for
sections, questions, or answers.

=cut

sub getEditVars {
    my $self    = shift;
    my ($address) = validate_pos(@_, { type => ARRAYREF });
    # Figure out what to do by counting the number of elements in the $address array ref

    }
    elsif ( $count == 3 ) {
        return $self->getAnswerEditVars($address);
    }
}

=head2 getGotoTargets

Generates the list of valid goto targets

=cut

    # ..all combined
    return [ @section_vars, @question_vars, @special_vars ];
}

=head2 getSectionEditVars ( $address )

Get a safe copy of the variables for this section, to use for editing
purposes.  

Adds two variables:

=over 4

=item * id

the index of this section

=item * displayed_id

this question's index in a 1-based array (versus the default, perl style, 0-based array)

=back

It removes the questions array ref, and changes questionsPerPage from a single element, into
an array of hashrefs, which list the available questions per page and which one is currently
selected for this section.

=head3 $address

See L<"Address Parameter">. Specifies which question to fetch variables for.

=cut

    return \%var;
}

=head2 getQuestionEditVars ( $address )

Get a safe copy of the variables for this question, to use for editing purposes.  

Adds two variables:

=over 4

=item * id 

the index of the question's position in its parent's section array joined by dashes '-'
See L<WebGUI::Asset::Wobject::Survey::ResponseJSON/questionIndex>.

=item * displayed_id

this question's index in a 1-based array (versus the default, perl style, 0-based array).

=back

It removes the answers array ref, and changes questionType from a single element, into
an array of hashrefs, which list the available question types and which one is currently
selected for this question.

=head2 getAnswerEditVars ( $address )

Get a safe copy of the variables for this answer, to use for editing purposes. 

Adds two variables:

=over 4

=item * id 

The index of the answer's position in its parent's question  and section arrays joined by dashes '-'
See L<WebGUI::Asset::Wobject::Survey::ResponseJSON/answerIndex>.

    $var{displayed_id} = aIndex($address) + 1;

    return \%var;
}

=head2 compress

Returns a copy of L<sections> with all redundancy (relative to L<mold>) removed.
That is, any section/question/answer property that matches the mold is removed from
the array object that is returned.

This is handy for shinking down the L<sections> hash as much as possible prior
to json-encoding and storing in the db (see L<freeze>).

=head2 uncompress ($sections)

Modifies the supplied arrayref of sections, adding back in all redundancy that has been 
removed by a previous call to L<compress>. Typically this is done immediately after
retrieving serialised surveyJSON from the db (see L<db>).

Any L<mold> property missing from the supplied list of section/question/answers is added,
and then the modified arrayref is returned.

=head3 sections

An arrayref of sections that you want to uncompress. Typically retrieved from the database.

    # Return the modified arrayref
    return $sections;
}

=head2 update ( $address, $properties )

Update a section/question/answer with $properties, or add new ones.  
Does not return anything significant.

=head3 $address

See L<"Address Parameter">. 

The number of elements in $address determines the behaviour:

=over 4

=item * 0 elements

Do Nothing

=item * 1 element

Update the addressed section with $properties. If the section does not exist, such
as by using an out of bounds array index, then a new section is appended
to the list of sections.

=item * 2 elements

Update the addressed question with $properties. 

=item * 3 elements

Update the addressed answer with $properties. 

=back

=head3 $properties

A perl hash reference.  Note, that it is not checked for type, so it is
possible to add a "question" object into the list of sections.
$properties should never be a partial object, but contain all properties.

=cut

=head2 insertObject ( $object, $address )

Rearrange existing objects in the current data structure. 
Does not return anything significant.

=head3 $object

A perl hash reference.  Note, that it is not checked for homegeneity,
so it is possible to add a "question" object into the list of section
objects.

=head3 $address

See L<"Address Parameter">. 

The number of elements in $address determines the behaviour:

=over 4

=item * 0 elements

Do Nothing

=item * 1 element

Reposition $object immediately after the indexed section

=item * 2 elements

Reposition $object immediately after the indexed question

=item * 3 elements

Reposition $object immediately after the indexed answer

=head2 copy ( $address )

Duplicate the indexed section or question, and push the copy onto the end of the
list of existing items. Modifies $address. Returns $address with the last element changed 
to the highest index in that array.

=head3 $address

See L<"Address Parameter">. 

The number of elements in $address determines the behaviour:

=over 4

=item * 1 element

Duplice the indexed section onto the end of the array of sections.

=item * 2 elements

Duplice the indexed question onto the end of the array of questions.

=item * 3 elements, or more

Nothing happens. It is not allowed to duplicate answers.

Delete the section/question/answer indexed by $address. Modifies $address if it has 1 or more elements.

=head3 $address

See L<"Address Parameter">. 

The number of elements in $address determines the behaviour:

=over 4

=item * 1 element

Remove the indexed section. Normally, the first section, index 0, cannot be removed.  See $movingOverride below.

=item * 2 elements

Remove the indexed question
