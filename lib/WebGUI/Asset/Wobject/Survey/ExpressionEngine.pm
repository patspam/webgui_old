=head1 NAME

Package WebGUI::Asset::Wobject::Survey::ExpressionEngine

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used to process Survey gotoExpressions.

If you want to allow the expression engine to run you need to turn on the enableSurveyExpressionEngine flag
in your site config file. This is because no matter how 'Safe' the Safe.pm compartment is, it still has
caveats. For example, it doesn't protect you from infinite loops.  

See L<run> for more details.

=head2 value

Utility sub that gives expressions access to recorded response values

Returns the recorded response value for the answer to question_variable

=cut

sub value {
    my $key   = shift;
    _validateVariable($key, 'value');
    my $value = $tags->{$key} || $values->{$key};

=head2 valueX

Same as L<value>, except that first argument is an asset spec (assetId or url), which must resolve
to a valid survey instance. The sub is applied to the most recent completed response for the user 
on the survey instance given by asset_spec.

=cut

sub valueX {
    my ( $asset_spec, $key ) = @_;
    
    # See if $otherInstances already contains the external survey

=head2 score

Utility sub that gives expressions access to recorded response scores.

If the argument is a question variable, returns the score for the answer selected for question_variable.

If the argument is a section variable, returns the summed score for the answers to all the questions in section_variable

If two arguments are provided, the first argument is assumed to be an asset spec (assetId or url). In this
case the sub is applied to the most recent completed response for the user on the survey instance given by asset_spec.

=cut

sub score {
    my $key = shift;
    _validateVariable($key, 'score');
    my $score = $scores->{$key};
    $session->log->debug("score($key) resolves to [$score]");
    return $score;
}

=head2 scoreX

Same as L<score>, except that first argument is an asset spec (assetId or url), which must resolve
to a valid survey instance. The sub is applied to the most recent completed response for the user 
on the survey instance given by asset_spec.

=cut

sub scoreX {

        die( { otherInstance => $asset_spec } );
    }
}

=head2 _validateVariable ($key, $fn)

Convenience sub to do optional validation of variable names

=cut

sub _validateVariable {
    my $key = shift;
    my $fn = shift || 'unspecified function';
    if ( $validTargets && !exists $validTargets->{$key} ) {

        $session->log->debug($error);
        die($error) if $validate;
        return;
    }
    return 1;
}

=head2 answered

Returns true/false depending on whether use has actually reached and responded to the given question

If two arguments are provided, the first argument is assumed to be an asset spec (assetId or url). In this
case the sub is applied to the most recent completed response for the user on the survey instance given by asset_spec.

=cut

sub answered {
    my $key   = shift;
    
    _validateVariable($key, 'answered');
    my $answered = exists $values->{$key};
    $session->log->debug("answered($key) returns [$answered]");
    return $answered;
}

=head2 answeredX

Same as L<answered>, except that first argument is an asset spec (assetId or url), which must resolve
to a valid survey instance. The sub is applied to the most recent completed response for the user 
on the survey instance given by asset_spec.

=cut

sub answeredX {
    my ( $asset_spec, $key ) = @_;
    
    # See if $otherInstances already contains the external survey
    if (my $otherInstance = $otherInstances->{$asset_spec}) {

        die( { otherInstance => $asset_spec } );
    }
}

=head2 tag ($name, [$value])

=head3 $name

Name of tag to set

=head3 $value (optional)

Value of tag to set. Defaults to 1 (boolean true flag).

=cut

sub tag {
    my ($name, $value) = @_;
    $value = 1 if !defined $value;
    $session->log->debug("Setting tag [$name] to [$value]");
    $tags->{$name} = $value;
}

=head2 tagged ($name)

Utility sub that gives expressions access to tagged data

=head3 $name

Name of tag whose value is returned.

=cut

sub tagged {
    my ($name) = @_;
    if (@_ == 2) {
        my $args = join ',', @_;
        $session->log->warn("Two arguments passed to tagged($args). Did you mean tag($args)?");
    }
    my $value = $tags->{$name};
    $session->log->debug("tagged($name) resolves to [$value]");
    return $value;
}

=head2 taggedX

Same as L<tagged>, except that first argument is an asset spec (assetId or url), which must resolve
to a valid survey instance. The sub is applied to the most recent completed response for the user 
on the survey instance given by asset_spec.

=cut

sub taggedX {
    my ( $asset_spec, $name ) = @_;
    
    if (@_ == 3) {
        my $args = join ',', @_;
        $session->log->warn("Three arguments passed to taggedX($args). Did you mean tag($args)?");

        die( { otherInstance => $asset_spec } );
    }
}

=head2 jump

Utility sub shared with Safe compartment so that expressions can call individual jump tests.

Throws an exception containing the jump target when a jump matches, thus allowing L<run> to
catch the first successful jump.

=cut

sub jump(&$) {
    my ( $sub, $target ) = @_;
    $jumpCount++;

    # If $validTargets known, make sure target is valid
    if (!_validateVariable($target, 'jump')) {
        return; # skip jump but continue with expression
    }

    if ( $sub->() ) {
        $session->log->debug("jump call #$jumpCount is truthy");
        die( { jump => $target } );
    }
    else {
        $session->log->debug("jump call #$jumpCount is falsey");
    }
}

=head2 avg

Utility sub shared with Safe compartment to allows expressions to easily compute the average of a list

=cut

sub avg {
    my @vals = @_;
    return sum(@vals) / @vals;
}

=head2 run ( $session, $expression, $opts )

Class method.

Evaluates the given expression in a Safe compartment.

=head3 session

A WebGUI::Session

=head3 expression

The expression to run. 

A gotoExpression is essentially a perl expression that gets evaluated in a Safe compartment.

To access Section/Question recorded response values, the expression calls L<value>.
To access Section/Question recorded response scores, the expression calls L<score>.
To determine if a user reached and answered a question, the expression calls L<answered>.

All of these subs allow you to resolve values and scores from other completed survey
instances.

To trigger a jump, the expression calls L<jump>. The first truthy jump succeeds.

Expressions also have access to some useful utility subs such as avg(), and all of the 
handy subs from List::Util (min, max, sum, etc..).

A very simple expression that checks if the response to s1q1 is 0 might look like:
 
 jump { value(s1q1) == 0 } target

A more complicated gotoExpression with two possible jumps might look like:

 jump { value(q1) > 5 and value(s2q1) =~ m/textmatch/ } target1;
 jump { avg(value(q1), value(q2), value(home/anotherSurvey, q3)) > 10 } target2;

=head3 opts (optional)

Supported options are:

=over 3

=item * values

Hashref of values to make available to the expression via the L<value> utility sub

=item * scores

Hashref of scores to make available to the expression via the L<score> utility sub

=item * validTargets

A hashref of valid jump targets. If this is provided, all L<jump> calls will fail unless
the specified target is a key in the hashref.

=item * validate

Return errors rather than just logging them (useful for displaying survey validation errors to users)
