An In/Out board is used to keep track of whether people are currently
in/out of the office. It shows the current In/Out status of all WebGUI
users and also logs the reason the person has left, the time they
left and the time they return.  The log is viewable in two forms.  The first
is a summary of the current status for all users in the groups configured for
this In/Out board instance.  The second is a complete report of the history of
all status changes for those users.  This report can be setup to have restricted
viewing privileges and is templatable.</p>
<p>Users of the In/Out Board can select other users, called delegates, to update
their status for them.</p>
