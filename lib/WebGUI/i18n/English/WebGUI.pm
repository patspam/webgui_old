<p>

<b>body.content</b><br>
The the content on the current page.
<p>

<b>head.tags</b><br>
Tags that WebGUI automatically generates for you so that caching works the way it should, search engines can find you better, and other useful automated functionality. This should go in the &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; section of your style.

<p>
We suggest using something like this in the &lt;title&gt; &lt;/title&gt; portion of your style:
<p>

&lt;tmpl_var session.page.title&gt; - &lt;tmpl_var session.setting.companyName&gt;

<p>
That particular example will help you get good ranking on search engines.

Username is a unique identifier for a user. Sometimes called a handle, it is also how the user will be known on the site. (<i>Note:</i> Administrators have unlimited power in the WebGUI system. This also means they are capable of breaking the system. If you rename or create a user, be careful not to use a username already in existence.)

		message => q|There are several groups built into WebGUI:
<p>

<b>Admins</b><br>
Admins are users who have unlimited privileges within WebGUI. A user should only be added to the admin group if they oversee the system. Usually only one to three people will be added to this group.  Once a person has been added to this group, their UI level is automatically updated to 9.
<p>

<b>Content Managers</b><br>
Content managers are users who have privileges to add, edit, and delete content from various areas on the site. The content managers group should not be used to control individual content areas within the site, but to determine whether a user can edit content at all. You should set up additional groups to separate content areas on the site.
<p>

<b>Everyone</b><br>
Everyone is a magic group in that no one is ever physically inserted into it, but yet all members of the site are part of it. If you want to open up your site to both visitors and registered users, use this group to do it.
<p>

<b>Export Managers</b><br>
Members of this group are allowed to export pages to disk.
<p>

<b>Package Managers</b><br>
Users that have privileges to add, edit, and delete packages of wobjects and pages to deploy.
<p>

<b>Registered Users</b><br>
When users are added to the system they are put into the registered users group. A user should only be removed from this group if their account is deleted or if you wish to punish a troublemaker.
<p>

<b>Secondary Admins</b><br>
Users in the Secondary Admins group may add new users, but cannot edit users. Also, if 
you are a Secondary Admin for a group, you may modify the membership of that group.
<p>

<b>Style Managers</b><br>
Users that have privileges to edit styles for this site. These privileges do not allow the user to assign styles to a page, just define them to be used.
<p>

<b>Template Managers</b><br>
Users that have privileges to edit templates for this site.
<p>

<b>Turn Admin On</b><br>
These users are allowed to turn on Admin mode.
<p>

<b>Visitors</b><br>
Visitors are users who are not logged in using an account on the system. Also, if you wish to punish a registered user you could remove him/her from the Registered Users group and insert him/her into the Visitors group.

<p>
The Groups page displays all groups that you are allowed to edit.  The form on the page allows you to display a subset of those groups.  The search engine uses SQL wildcards like '%' instead of the familiar ones used by internet search engines.

To validate users against an external database, you need to construct a SQL statement that will return 1 if a user is in the group.  Make sure to begin your statement with "select 1".  You may use macros in this query to access data in a user's profile, such as Employee ID.  Here is an example that checks a user against a fictional HR database.  This assumes you have created an additional WebGUI profile field called employeeId.<br>
<br>
select 1 from employees, health_plans, empl_plan_map<br>
where employees.employee_id = &#94;User("employeeId");<br>
and health_plans.plan_name = 'HMO 1'<br>
and employees.employee_id = empl_plan_map.employee_id<br>
and health_plans.health_plan_id = empl_plan_mp.health_plan_id<br>
<br>
This group could then be named "Employees in HMO 1", and would allow you to restrict any page or wobject to only those users who are part of this health plan in the external database.

<p>
The following style sheet classes are available:
<p>

<b>.tab</b><br>
The default look of each tab.
<p>

<b>div.tabs</b><br>
This also sets some properties for all of the tabs. This should be used for the text labels in the tabs.
<p>


<b>.tabBody</b><br>
The content area for each tab. This is where the form will show up. Note that for best results the background color of this should match the background color of .tabActive.
<p>


<b>.tabHover</b><br>
The look of a tab as the mouse hovers over it.
<p>

<b>.tabActive</b><br>
The look of the tab that is currently visible.
<p>

<p>


If you are unfamiliar with how to use CSS, <a href="http://www.plainblack.com/">Plain Black</a> provides training classes on XHTML and CSS. Alternatively, Bradsoft makes an excellent CSS editor called <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/index.asp">Top Style</a>.
<p>


The following is a list of classes used to control the default look of WebGUI. These of course can be overridden or replaced in the various templates that generate them.
<p>


<b>A</b><br>
The links throughout the style.
<p>


<b>BODY</b><br>
The default setup of all pages within a style.
<p>


<b>H1</b><br>
The headers on every page.
<p>


<b>.content</b><br>
The main content area on all pages of the style.
<p>


<b>.formDescription </b><br>
The tags on all forms next to the form elements. 
<p>


<b>.formSubtext </b><br>
The tags below some form elements.
<p>


<b>.highlight </b><br>
Denotes a highlighted item, such as which message you are viewing within a list.
<p>




<b>.pagination </b><br>
The Previous and Next links on pages with pagination.
<p>




<b>.tableData </b><br>
The data rows on things like message boards and user contributions.
<p>


<b>.tableHeader </b><br>
The headings of columns on things like message boards and user contributions.
<p>




<b>NOTE:</b> Some wobjects and macros have their own unique styles sheet classes, which are documented in their individual help files.

<p>Many Assets allow you to control HTML and javascript that is entered by users, but that is

<p>It works much like the Search and Replace function of word processors.  First, enter
a string to be searched for.  Then enter in the string that you want to replace it.</p>

<p>Most of the time, this Content Filter will be used to remove offensive words such as slang,
curses or racial slurs.  However, it can also be used as a preprocessor for inline macros.  See
the default replacements that ship with WebGUI for examples.</p>

<p>Packages are groups of Assets that are predefined to be redeployed
together. It works exactly the same as the clipboard, except that you
do not need to cut or copy the Assets before redeploying, or pasting,
the Assets in other areas of the site.</p>

<p>Packages are often defined to lessen the burden of repetitive tasks. A
package manager may see the need to create a package several of pages with
a message board, an FAQ, and a Poll because that task is performed often.</p>

<p>In order to define or delete packages you must be in the Package
Managers group or in the Admins group.</p>

<p>To create a package follow these simple steps, just go the Metadata tab of
any Asset's Add/Edit form and select "Make package?".  The Package will consist of
that Asset and all Assets below it.</p>

<p>To deploy a Package:
<ol>
<li>Point your browser at a page on the site where you want to deploy the Package.</li>
<li>Enable Admin mode.</li>
<li>Select the Package tab from the Admin Bar.</li>
<li>Click on the name of the Package to deploy.</li>
</ol>

<p>All Asset URLs in the Package will be made unique after being deployed.</p>

<p><b>Assets</b><br />
Everything inside of WebGUI is an Asset: files, images, forums, threads in forums, posts in threads, templates, Wobjects (like Articles, DataForms, EventsCalendars) and more.
</p>

<p><b>captcha</b><br />
An image displaying a message along with lines or shades that make it hard for a computer
to do character recognition.  Used in WebGUI to prevent accounts from being created by programs or spiders.
</p>

<p><b>locked</b><br />
If Posts and Threads are "locked", no new posts can be added and no existing posts can be edited.

<p><b>Macros</b><br />
Macros are used to create dynamic content within content that would otherwise be unchanging.  For
example, showing today's date, or the name of the user on a page can be done with Macros.
</p>

<p><b>Passwords</b><br />
The validity of a password in WebGUI depends on what kind of authentication system
is used.  If the default, WebGUI authentication, is used, passwords may be made of
any characters so it meets the minimum length set by the Administrator.
</p>

<p><b>sticky</b><br />
If Posts and Threads are set to being "sticky", they will appear at the top of the Forum listing.
</p>

<p><b>UI level</b><br />
For WebGUI Content Managers and Admins, the Asset and Wobject edit
screens can be configured to make them easier to use, based on each
user's UI level.  The UI level can be altered by Admins in the user's profile.
Users added to the Admin group have their UI level automatically set to 9
to give them full access to the site controls.
</p>

<p><b>Usernames</b><br />
WebGUI usernames cannot start or begin with any kind of space (spaces, tabs, etc.) and can only be made of letters, numbers, or dashes, underscores, periods, commas or @ signs.
</p>

<p><b>Wobjects</b><br />
If you think of Assets as "things" inside of WebGUI, then Wobject are
"things" that "do stuff".  Articles are used to display content, DataForms
are for collecting data from users (and optionally emailing a copy), and
Message Boards hold forums for users.  There are many different Wobjects in WebGUI.
